# Array Manipulation and User Info

## Student ID: [11074191]

### Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
This task involves creating two functions in a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`:
1. `processArray`: This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
2. `formatArrayStrings`: This function takes two arrays as arguments - an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 2: userInfo.js
This task involves creating a function in a JavaScript file named `userInfo.js`:
1. `createUserProfiles`: This function takes an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 1. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 3: README.md
